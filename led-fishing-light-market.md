<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LED Fishing Light Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Light</li><li>Underwater Light</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The LED fishing light market comprises primarily two types: water lights and underwater lights. Water lights are designed to float on the surface, attracting fish from a distance with their bright illumination. They are typically used in shallow waters and are effective for night fishing. Underwater lights, on the other hand, are submerged, emitting light below the surface to attract fish closer to the boat. Both types enhance visibility and significantly increase catch rates during nighttime fishing activities.</p></p>
