<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wall Mounted Gas Boiler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensing</li><li>Non-Condensing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wall-mounted gas boiler market is primarily divided into two types: condensing and non-condensing boilers. Condensing boilers are designed to maximize energy efficiency by capturing and reusing heat from exhaust gases, resulting in lower energy bills and reduced emissions. Non-condensing boilers, on the other hand, operate at higher temperatures and do not recycle exhaust heat, making them less efficient and environmentally friendly. The choice between these types depends on factors like energy efficiency needs, installation costs, and local regulations.</p></p>
