<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-contained Breathing Apparatus Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Circuit SCBA</li><li>Closed-Circuit SCBA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Self-contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) market is divided into two main types: Open-Circuit SCBA and Closed-Circuit SCBA. Open-Circuit SCBA delivers breathable air from a pressurized tank, exhaling waste air directly into the environment, making it suitable for short-duration use in hazardous conditions. In contrast, Closed-Circuit SCBA recycles exhaled air by removing carbon dioxide, making it more efficient for extended operations, particularly in confined spaces. Both types are crucial for respiratory protection in industrial and emergency situations.</p></p>
