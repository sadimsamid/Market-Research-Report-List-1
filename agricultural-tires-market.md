<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Agriculture Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agricultural tires market is primarily divided into two types: radial and bias (crossply) tires. Radial agriculture tires feature a flexible sidewall and a more robust tread design, offering better fuel efficiency, traction, and overall performance. They are well-suited for modern farming machinery. In contrast, bias tires have a stiffer sidewall and a more traditional construction, providing durability and stability under heavy loads, making them suitable for older equipment and rugged terrains. Both types serve specific agricultural needs efficiently.</p></p>
